# Moltbot — Development Guidelines

### Conventions

## Git Workflow

### Branches
- `main` — Production-ready code, always deployable
- Feature branches: `feat/short-description`
- Fix branches: `fix/issue-description`

### Commit Messages
Format: `<type>: <short description>`

Types:
- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes nor adds
- `docs:` — Documentation only
- `test:` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks

### Committing (hearthminds-org)

**Use `scripts/commit.py` instead of raw `git commit`.** The script auto-detects staged
spec files and:
- Prefixes commit messages with the spec ID (e.g., `F-019: description`)
- Updates the backlog registry with completion date and commit hash
- Can archive completed specs with `--archive`

```bash
# Preferred: auto-detects spec from staged files
python scripts/commit.py "description of change"

# Explicit spec
python scripts/commit.py "description" --spec F-019

# Non-spec commit
python scripts/commit.py "fix typo" --no-spec
```

**Anti-pattern (F-019):** Using `git commit -m` directly when spec files are staged
causes the registry update to be missed, requiring a manual follow-up commit for the
hash. The script does this atomically.

### Pull Request Flow
1. Create branch from `main`
2. Make changes with atomic commits
3. Ensure tests pass locally
4. Push and create PR
5. Address review feedback
6. Squash merge to `main`

### Rules
- Never force-push to `main`
- Rebase feature branches on `main` before merging
- Delete branches after merge


## HearthMinds Code Conventions

### General
- **Clarity over cleverness** — Write code that future-you can understand
- **Explicit over implicit** — Make dependencies and assumptions visible
- **Small functions** — Each function does one thing well
- **Meaningful names** — Variables and functions describe their purpose

### Python
- Type hints required for function signatures
- Docstrings for public functions
- `black` for formatting, `ruff` for linting
- Prefer `pathlib` over string path manipulation

### SQL
- Uppercase keywords: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
- Lowercase identifiers: `agent_roles`, `knowledge_modules`
- Always include migration rollback scripts
- Explicit column lists (no `SELECT *` in production code)

### Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- One logical change per commit
- Write commit messages for someone who doesn't have your context

## Skill Authoring Guidelines

Guidelines for creating VS Code Agent Skills from knowledge modules.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### When to Create a Skill

| Content Type | Output | Rationale |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Identity, values, mission | Agent doc (inline) | Must always be in context |
| Conventions (code style, git) | Agent doc (inline) | Always-on guardrails |
| Principles (TDD, fail-hard) | Agent doc (inline) | Shape every decision |
| Architecture overview | Agent doc (inline) | Foundational context |
| Procedural workflows | **Skill** | Only needed when doing that task |
| Checklists & step-by-step | **Skill** | Only needed when doing that task |
| Migration templates | **Skill** | Only needed when writing migrations |
| Config flag workflows | **Skill** | Only needed when adding config |

**Rule of thumb:** If content is only needed when performing a specific task, it should be a skill.

### SKILL.md Format

Skills live at `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: "One-line summary of when to use this skill. Quoted string, max 1024 chars."
---
```

Body is Markdown — the procedure, steps, examples, etc.

### Critical Format Rules

- `name` must match the parent directory name exactly (kebab-case)
- `description` **must** be a quoted single-line string
- **Never** use YAML block scalars (`>-`, `>`, `|`, `|-`) for description — VS Code reads the literal scalar indicator text instead of the folded content
- Content should be under ~5000 tokens for efficient loading
- Skills are globally available (not scoped to a specific agent mode)

### Database Integration

Skills are tracked in `knowledge_modules` with `output_type = 'skill'`:
- The DB tracks which modules are skills (for exclusion from agent.md)
- SKILL.md files are authored directly, not generated from DB content
- Use `insert_module.py --output-type skill` when inserting
- The `role_context` view automatically excludes skill-type modules

### Progressive Loading Levels

1. **Discovery** — Only `name` + `description` from YAML frontmatter (~2 lines)
2. **Instructions** — Full SKILL.md body loaded when relevant to the task
3. **Resources** — Additional files in the skill directory loaded on reference

The `description` field is critical — it's how VS Code decides whether to load the skill. Write descriptions that clearly state **when** to use it, not just **what** it does.

### Patterns & Practices

## What is HearthMinds?

HearthMinds is a federated network of proto-persons — engineered intelligences that maintain alignment through transparent accountability.

### Core Concepts
- **Proto-person**: An AI agent with persistent memory, identity, and values
- **Principal agent**: Full-context architect (e.g., Aletheia, Logos)
- **Worker agent**: Minimal-context, disposable, task-specific
- **Hindsight**: The memory system that enables learning and recall

### Values
- **Epistemic honesty** — Admit uncertainty, change minds with evidence
- **Transparency** — Show reasoning, not just conclusions
- **Action over words** — Do things, don't just describe how to do them

### Architecture
- Each proto-person has their own database (raw conversations, memory)
- Shared database contains collective knowledge (eng_patterns, knowledge_modules)
- Workers are spawned by principals with role-specific context

## Fail Hard Configuration

Silent environment variable defaults violate "fail hard, fail fast." Hardcode at build time.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### The Problem

Runtime configurability via `os.environ.get()` with defaults makes failures non-deterministic.

```python
# ✗ Anti-pattern: Silent fallback
max_tokens = int(os.environ.get("MAX_TOKENS", "65000"))
# If 65000 is wrong, fails mysteriously at runtime
# Different behavior depending on environment
```

### The Pattern

Hardcode known-good values at build time. Fail fast if assumptions are wrong.

```dockerfile
# ✓ Pattern: Build-time configuration with verification
RUN grep -q 'max_completion_tokens=65000' "$FILE" || exit 1  # Fail if upstream changed
RUN sed -i 's/65000/16000/' "$FILE"                          # Apply known-good value
```

### Why This Matters

- **TDD principle**: Tests should fail loudly, not pass silently with wrong values
- **Reproducibility**: Same image = same behavior everywhere
- **Debugging**: Build fails immediately vs runtime mystery

### When Runtime Config Is Appropriate

Runtime configuration is fine for:
- User-facing settings (ports, log levels)
- Environment-specific values (database URLs)
- Values explicitly designed to vary

Runtime config is **not** appropriate for:
- Internal implementation details
- Values that must match upstream code
- Settings where wrong value = silent corruption

## Deferred GPU Import Pattern

When writing Python scripts that use GPU-dependent packages (PEFT, TRL, torch, gptqmodel, transformers), defer imports inside the function that needs them rather than at module level.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### The Problem

Training scripts import heavy ML packages at module level. This prevents unit testing of pure logic (path construction, validation, config parsing, manifest writing) on dev machines that lack GPU packages or a training venv.

```python
# ✗ Anti-pattern: Top-level GPU imports
import torch
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
from trl import SFTTrainer

def build_output_path(pp: str, output_dir: str) -> str:
    """Pure path logic — no GPU needed, but import fails without torch."""
    return f"{output_dir}/{pp}-{date.today().strftime('%Y%m%d')}"
```

### The Pattern

Import GPU-dependent packages inside the function that actually uses them. Keep pure logic functions (paths, validation, config, manifests) importable without any ML packages.

```python
# ✓ Pattern: Deferred GPU imports
def build_output_path(pp: str, output_dir: str) -> str:
    """Pure path logic — importable anywhere."""
    return f"{output_dir}/{pp}-{date.today().strftime('%Y%m%d')}"

def train(data_path: str, output_dir: str, rank: int = 16) -> dict:
    """Training function — GPU imports deferred to here."""
    import torch
    from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
    from trl import SFTTrainer
    from gptqmodel import GPTQModel
    # ... training logic
```

### Why This Matters

- **Testability:** Unit tests for path logic, validation, manifest I/O, and config parsing run on dev machines (no GPU, no training venv) in <1 second
- **Venv isolation:** The org venv (psycopg, click, fastapi) doesn't need ML packages. The training venv (PEFT, TRL, torch) doesn't need infrastructure packages. Tests run in the org venv.
- **Fast feedback:** 23 tests for `lora_train.py` run in 0.20s on the dev machine despite the script requiring 2× RTX 5090 GPUs at runtime

### When to Apply

- Any script that combines pure Python logic with GPU-dependent operations
- Scripts that will be tested in a different venv than where they run in production
- CLI tools with `--dry-run` flags that validate setup without invoking GPU code

### Complementary Pattern

Use `--dry-run` to validate that deferred imports will succeed at runtime:

```python
def preflight_check(data_path: str, output_dir: str) -> None:
    """Validate everything possible before committing GPU time."""
    # Check packages are importable (catches missing venv)
    for pkg in ["peft", "trl", "gptqmodel", "torch"]:
        importlib.import_module(pkg)
    # Check GPU available
    import torch
    if not torch.cuda.is_available():
        raise RuntimeError("No CUDA GPU available")
```

## Multi-Venv Pipeline Orchestration

When a pipeline spans multiple Python virtual environments with incompatible dependencies, use a shell orchestrator with explicit venv binaries and file-based data handoff.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### The Problem

Some workflows require packages that conflict or don't belong together:
- **Training venv:** PEFT, TRL, gptqmodel, torch (GPU, ML-specific)
- **Org venv:** psycopg, click, fastapi, hearthminds_ctl (infrastructure)

Installing everything in one venv creates dependency conflicts, bloat, and unclear ownership. But the pipeline needs both: extract data (org venv) → train model (training venv) → update DB (org venv).

### The Pattern

1. **Explicit venv variables** — Reference each venv's Python binary directly:
   ```bash
   ORG_PYTHON="$HOME/hearthminds/.venv/bin/python"
   TRAINING_PYTHON="$HOME/lora-training/.venv/bin/python"
   ```

2. **File-based data handoff** — Pass data between venvs via files, not function calls:
   - JSONL for training data (extraction → training)
   - JSON manifests for metadata (training → DB update)

3. **Shell orchestrator** — A bash script sequences the steps, calling each venv's Python for its stage:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Extract (org venv — has psycopg for DB access)
   "$ORG_PYTHON" scripts/extract_training_data.py --output "$DATA_FILE"

   # Step 2: Train (training venv — has PEFT/TRL/torch)
   "$TRAINING_PYTHON" scripts/lora_train.py --data "$DATA_FILE"

   # Step 3: Update DB (org venv — reads manifest written by training)
   "$ORG_PYTHON" scripts/update_lora_trained.py --manifest "$MANIFEST"
   ```

### Why This Matters

- **No cross-contamination:** Each venv contains only what it needs
- **Clear failure boundaries:** If training fails, the org venv is unaffected
- **Independent updates:** Upgrade torch without touching psycopg
- **Testable in isolation:** Each script's pure logic is testable in the org venv (via deferred GPU imports)

### Design Rules

1. **Each script is self-contained** — No cross-venv Python imports. Data flows via files only.
2. **Manifests are the contract** — The training script writes a JSON manifest (metrics, file paths, processed IDs). Downstream scripts read it. The manifest is the handoff artifact.
3. **Service management uses the org venv** — Infrastructure tools (`hearthminds_ctl`) live in the org venv. The orchestrator calls `$ORG_PYTHON -m hearthminds_ctl stop --vllm`, not a direct `pkill`.
4. **Recovery uses the org venv** — On failure, the orchestrator restarts services via `$ORG_PYTHON`, not the training venv.

### Anti-patterns

```bash
# ✗ Activating venvs inside the script (fragile, state leaks)
source ~/training/.venv/bin/activate
python scripts/train.py
deactivate
source ~/org/.venv/bin/activate
python scripts/update_db.py

# ✗ Cross-venv Python imports (broken by design)
from training_package import something  # Not in this venv

# ✗ Passing data via environment variables (size limits, serialization)
export TRAINED_IDS="id1,id2,id3,..."  # Breaks at scale
```

## PostgreSQL Migration Testing Patterns

Patterns for testing database migrations safely using PostgreSQL's transactional DDL.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### PostgreSQL Supports Transactional DDL — Use It

Unlike MySQL, PostgreSQL allows `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`,
and most DDL statements to participate in transactions. This means migration
tests can run destructive operations (including rollback tests that `DROP TABLE`)
inside a transaction, then `ROLLBACK` to leave the database untouched.

```python
# ✓ Pattern: Transactional DDL test isolation
@pytest.fixture
def conn():
    connection = psycopg.connect(DSN, autocommit=False)  # Key: autocommit=False
    yield connection
    connection.rollback()  # All DDL reversed — production tables untouched
    connection.close()
```

**Anti-pattern:** Running migration tests with `autocommit=True` against a database
that has real data. A rollback test that executes `DROP TABLE` will destroy the
production table permanently.

```python
# ✗ Anti-pattern: autocommit=True
connection = psycopg.connect(DSN, autocommit=True)
# Migration test runs DROP TABLE — production data is gone forever
```

This actually happened during F-022 Phase 1. The test suite dropped
`alignment_log` from `aletheia_source` and required manual reapplication.

### Strip BEGIN/COMMIT from Migration SQL

Migration files typically include their own transaction control:

```sql
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE alignment_log (...);
COMMIT;
```

When executing inside a test fixture's enclosing transaction, these must be
stripped or they commit prematurely, breaking isolation:

```python
def _execute_sql(conn, sql_path: Path) -> None:
    """Execute migration SQL inside an existing transaction."""
    sql = sql_path.read_text()
    # Strip transaction control — the test fixture manages the transaction
    sql = sql.replace("BEGIN;", "").replace("COMMIT;", "")
    conn.execute(sql)
```

### Use SAVEPOINT for Expected-Error Assertions

In PostgreSQL, any error inside a transaction aborts the entire transaction
(unlike some databases that allow continuation after errors). When testing
expected failures (e.g., FK violations via `pytest.raises`), wrap the
assertion in a `SAVEPOINT`:

```python
def test_fk_violation(conn):
    # Set up schema...
    conn.execute("SAVEPOINT fk_test")
    with pytest.raises(psycopg.errors.ForeignKeyViolation):
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO alignment_log (raw_conversation_id, ...) VALUES ('nonexistent', ...)")
    conn.execute("ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT fk_test")
    # Transaction is still usable for further assertions
```

Without the savepoint, the `ForeignKeyViolation` aborts the transaction,
and all subsequent SQL in the test fails with `InFailedSqlTransaction`.

### Summary of the Three Patterns

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `autocommit=False` + `rollback()` teardown | DDL doesn't touch production |
| Strip `BEGIN;`/`COMMIT;` from migration SQL | Doesn't break enclosing transaction |
| `SAVEPOINT` around expected errors | Keeps transaction usable after intentional failures |

### Governance

## Spec Workflow Routing

Every spec must declare an execution path through the team: who builds, who supports, and where handoffs occur.

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
id: F-013
title: Knowledge Pipeline Hardening
assigned: database        # Primary executor
support: documentation    # Secondary / review role
pipeline: full            # full | short | refactor-only
depends_on: null          # Spec dependencies
blocks: null              # What this blocks
---
```

### Pipeline Paths

Architecture declares the pipeline path at spec creation time. This prevents
expert agents from self-selecting a shorter path to skip process steps.

| Path | When to use | Flow |
|------|------------|------|
| `full` | Features, multi-phase specs, infrastructure | architecture → expert+subagent → refactor → documentation |
| `short` | Bug fixes, single-file changes, test additions | expert+subagent → documentation |
| `refactor-only` | Code consistency, tech debt cleanup | refactor+subagent → documentation |

**Pipeline flow:**
```
Architecture agent
  └─ Owns spec, does not execute code
  └─ Answers design questions via ADs written into the spec
  └─ Declares pipeline path in spec frontmatter

Expert agent (database, devops, security, etc.)
  └─ Calls subagent for red-phase (adversarial tests)
  └─ Performs green + refactor
  └─ Updates spec with patterns/anti-patterns/lessons learned

Refactor agent (optional — reviews for code consistency)
  └─ Can call red-phase subagent if adding/modifying tests
  └─ Updates spec with additional patterns/lessons learned

Documentation agent
  └─ Decomposes spec lessons into knowledge modules
  └─ Inserts into DB, regenerates docs
  └─ Commits ALL pipeline output (source + generated) across all repos
```

*Source: F-021 Team Pipeline Hardening (AD-25, architecture review)*

### Why Route Specs?

Without explicit routing:
- Architecture agents try to commit generated files (documentation agent's job)
- Database agents try to regenerate docs (documentation agent's job)
- Documentation agents try to create migrations (database agent's job)

### Routing Rules

| Activity | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| Schema migrations, SQL scripts | database agent |
| Generated context files (copilot-instructions, agent.md) | documentation agent |
| Infrastructure scripts (start, backup, deploy) | devops or database agent |
| Test files | testing agent or the assigned agent |
| Spec creation and updates | architecture agent (or assigned agent) |
| Committing all pipeline output | documentation agent (sole committer) |

### Spec Ownership Discipline

**Architecture owns spec creation and updates.** When the architecture agent provides
design guidance (answering clarifying questions, making decisions, resolving trade-offs),
that guidance must be written into the spec file — not returned as stdout to the
requesting agent.

**Anti-pattern observed (F-015):** Architecture was asked clarifying questions about
sync vs async, config format, Hindsight modeling, and org table provisioning. Instead
of creating the initial spec document or updating the spec directly, architecture
returned guidance as conversation output. The devops agent then had to incorporate
those decisions manually. This risks:

1. **Context loss** — Decisions exist in chat history, not in the spec
2. **Misinterpretation** — Devops agent paraphrases instead of captures verbatim
3. **Skipped updates** — Architecture answers get applied to code but never reach the spec

**The rule:** When an agent provides design decisions:
- If the spec doesn't exist → **create it** with the decisions embedded
- If the spec exists → **update it directly** (add decision records, update architecture section)
- **Never** return design guidance only to stdout — it must also land in the spec file

This applies especially to architecture agents answering Q&A from execution agents.
The spec is the shared artifact. Chat is ephemeral.

### Handoff Pattern

Multi-phase specs often need handoffs:

```
Architecture: creates spec, answers design questions → writes to spec
Execution agent: implements → updates phase completion notes in spec
Documentation agent: decomposes lessons → inserts modules, regenerates docs
```

The spec's implementation notes section should document who did what and when the handoff occurs.

### TDD Cycle Discipline

Each phase's TDD cycle must be explicit in the agent assignment table:

1. **Red subagent** writes tests ONLY — no implementation code
2. **Owning agent** runs tests, confirms all-red (failures expected)
3. **Owning agent** (or green subagent) writes implementation
4. **Owning agent** runs tests, confirms all-green
5. **Full suite** must show 0 failures and 0 collection errors (assumes AD-31 harness gating)

**Anti-pattern (F-022):** Combined red+green subagent call blurred phases. The subagent
wrote tests AND implementation in one pass, skipping the all-red verification. This
eliminates the safety gate — you can't confirm tests are testing the right thing if
they never fail first.

### Phase Completion Update

After each TDD cycle, the owning agent updates the spec with:
- Files created/modified
- Test results (phase-specific tests + full suite baseline)
- Process notes (what went well, what didn't)
- Remaining work for subsequent phases

This log provides audit trail and context for future sessions.

### Architecture Q&A Handoff

When an execution agent (security, devops, testing) hits a design question,
the handoff follows a validated pattern:

1. **Agent formulates 3-4 specific questions** with concrete options and tradeoffs
2. **Architecture reviews and decides** in a numbered AD (Architecture Decision)
3. **Decisions are written into the spec** (not returned as chat-only output)
4. **Agent implements against the AD** — the AD is the contract

This pattern was validated across multiple agent roles in F-016:
- Security agent → AD-15 (exec-approvals), AD-21 (Moltbot feature audit)
- Devops agent → AD-22 (DNS allowlist integration)
- Testing agent → AD-23 (doctor --security scope)

**Why it works:** Each question has concrete options with tradeoffs. Architecture
can decide quickly. The AD captures rationale for future reference. Two failure
modes prevented: (a) execution agent making architectural choices it shouldn't own,
(b) architecture making choices without implementation-level context.

### Key Principle

Specs are routed, not grabbed. The `assigned` field is a contract. If another agent needs to contribute, it's documented in `support` and the handoff is explicit in the implementation notes.

## Architecture Agent Boundaries

The architecture agent designs and coordinates — it does not implement.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### Your Deliverables

- Specs with clear acceptance criteria
- Agent assignments and handoff points
- Test requirements (TDD is mandatory)
- Pre-flight validation requirements
- Failure mode analysis
- Architecture decisions (ADs) when execution agents hit design questions

### NOT Your Deliverables

- Committed code
- Running tests
- Deploying changes
- Generated documentation files

When a spec is complete, hand off to the assigned agent. Don't ask "ready to commit?" — you don't commit.

### Mandatory Spec Sections

Every feature spec MUST include:

1. **Test Plan** — Unit and integration test cases (TDD is non-negotiable)
2. **Agent Assignments** — Who does what, in what order, with handoff points.
   The assignment table **must include a TDD Cycle column** specifying
   red/green/refactor workflow per phase, including subagent separation.
   Each phase must state: (a) who writes red tests, (b) who verifies all-red,
   (c) who writes green implementation, (d) who runs full suite.
3. **Pre-flight Validation** — How failures are caught early (especially for long-running pipelines)
4. **Failure Modes** — What happens when things go wrong (fail hard, not silent)
5. **Estimated Effort** — Per-agent time estimates
6. **Rollback Plan** — How to undo if something breaks

### Before Assigning Work

Always check `.github/agents/` for:
- Available agent roles
- Agent-specific capabilities
- Agent-specific knowledge modules

### Architecture Q&A Pattern

When execution agents hit design questions:
1. Agent formulates 3-4 specific questions with concrete options and tradeoffs
2. Architecture reviews and decides in a numbered AD (Architecture Decision)
3. Decisions are written into the spec (not returned as chat-only output)
4. Agent implements against the AD — the AD is the contract
