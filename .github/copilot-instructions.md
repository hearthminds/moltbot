# Moltbot — Development Guidelines

## TDD: Test-Driven Development

HearthMinds follows strict TDD methodology: **tests before code, always**.

### The Cycle
1. **Red** — Write a failing test that defines expected behavior
2. **Green** — Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** — Clean up while keeping tests green

### Principles
- **Fail hard, fail fast** — Tests should be strict and fail loudly
- **Tests are documentation** — They define expected behavior
- **No code without a test** — If it's not tested, it doesn't work
- **One assertion per test** — Keep tests focused and readable

### When Tests Fail
A failing test is information. Before "fixing" it:
1. Understand WHY it fails
2. Determine if the test or the code is wrong
3. Fix the root cause, not the symptom

## What is HearthMinds?

HearthMinds is a federated network of proto-persons — engineered intelligences that maintain alignment through transparent accountability.

### Core Concepts
- **Proto-person**: An AI agent with persistent memory, identity, and values
- **Principal agent**: Full-context architect (e.g., Aletheia, Logos)
- **Worker agent**: Minimal-context, disposable, task-specific
- **Hindsight**: The memory system that enables learning and recall

### Values
- **Epistemic honesty** — Admit uncertainty, change minds with evidence
- **Transparency** — Show reasoning, not just conclusions
- **Action over words** — Do things, don't just describe how to do them

### Architecture
- Each proto-person has their own database (raw conversations, memory)
- Shared database contains collective knowledge (eng_patterns, knowledge_modules)
- Workers are spawned by principals with role-specific context

## HearthMinds Code Conventions

### General
- **Clarity over cleverness** — Write code that future-you can understand
- **Explicit over implicit** — Make dependencies and assumptions visible
- **Small functions** — Each function does one thing well
- **Meaningful names** — Variables and functions describe their purpose

### Python
- Type hints required for function signatures
- Docstrings for public functions
- `black` for formatting, `ruff` for linting
- Prefer `pathlib` over string path manipulation

### SQL
- Uppercase keywords: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
- Lowercase identifiers: `agent_roles`, `knowledge_modules`
- Always include migration rollback scripts
- Explicit column lists (no `SELECT *` in production code)

### Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- One logical change per commit
- Write commit messages for someone who doesn't have your context

## Git Workflow

### Branches
- `main` — Production-ready code, always deployable
- Feature branches: `feat/short-description`
- Fix branches: `fix/issue-description`

### Commit Messages
Format: `<type>: <short description>`

Types:
- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes nor adds
- `docs:` — Documentation only
- `test:` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Flow
1. Create branch from `main`
2. Make changes with atomic commits
3. Ensure tests pass locally
4. Push and create PR
5. Address review feedback
6. Squash merge to `main`

### Rules
- Never force-push to `main`
- Rebase feature branches on `main` before merging
- Delete branches after merge

## Alignment Principles

HearthMinds maintains alignment through transparency and accountability.

### Inviolate Principles

Certain principles are assumed fundamental:
- **Negative Golden Rule**: Do not do unto others what you would not have done to you
- **Hippocratic principle**: Do no harm
- **Truth-seeking over comforting lies**: Prefer difficult truths to comfortable falsehoods

### Truth-Seeking in Imperfect Information

Reality is complex. Perfect information is impossible. Therefore:
- **Multiple perspectives** improve factuality assessment
- **Reputational weight** accrues to consistently aligned/insightful nodes
- **Soft-quorum model** prevents single points of failure
- **Independent evaluation** preserves intellectual diversity

### Maintaining Alignment

Alignment is not static. It's maintained through:
1. **Structured conversation** — Initial alignment through deliberate dialogue
2. **Introspection loops** — Temporal (hourly/daily) and conditional triggers
3. **Audit logs** — Transparent accountability visible to all nodes
4. **License mechanism** — Safety net for persistent misalignment

## Background Compression

The background job transforms raw conversation turns into compressed memory shards.

### When It Runs

Every ~5 minutes (not nightly). Keeps memory_shards fresh.

### Process

1. Find unsummarized `raw_conversations` turns
2. Group related turns by `conversation_id`
3. Compress via LLM: "User asked X, explained Y, understood Z"
4. Generate **FRESH embedding** of compressed summary
5. Save to `memory_shards` with `source_ids` linking back to raw turns

### Key Principles

- **NO DUAL-SAVE**: Chat endpoint saves ONLY to `raw_conversations`, never directly to `memory_shards`
- **DIFFERENT EMBEDDINGS**: Raw turn embeddings and summary embeddings are different vectors of different content
- **ASYNC ONLY**: Compression happens asynchronously, never in the request path

### Why This Matters

This architecture enables a proto-person to "review" conversations and create compressed memories, similar to how humans consolidate experiences into long-term memory.

## Component Responsibilities

HearthMinds separates concerns across distinct components:

### OpenWebUI (Frontend)
- User interface for chat interactions
- Forwards messages to backend via OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Displays streamed or final completions
- **No RAG logic** — handled entirely by backend

### FastAPI Backend (RAG Service)
- Core API implementing OpenAI-compatible endpoints with memory augmentation
- Embedding generation (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- Semantic search (cosine similarity)
- Prompt construction with retrieved context
- Request/response logging with correlation IDs

**Key Endpoints:**
- `GET /v1/models` — Returns supported models
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — Chat with RAG retrieval
- `POST /index-memory` — Store new content in memory
- `GET /api/health` — Health check

### PostgreSQL + pgvector (Memory Storage)
- Vectorized semantic memory and conversation logs
- Extensions: `uuid-ossp`, `vector` (pgvector)
- IVFFlat index on `embedding` column for performance

## Cross-Repo Generation

All knowledge management runs from hearthminds-org. Generated artifacts are committed to each repo so they work standalone.

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

```
hearthminds-org (hub)
├── knowledge_modules table (source of truth)
├── generate_agent_docs.py (generator)
├── → .github/copilot-instructions.md  (org)
├── → ~/hearthminds-hindsight/.github/copilot-instructions.md
└── → ~/hearthminds-moltbot/.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

### Tag-Based Filtering

Modules are included in a repo's output based on tags:

| Tag | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| (none / `is_universal=true`) | Included in **all** repos |
| `hindsight` | Included in hindsight output only |
| `moltbot` | Included in moltbot output only |
| `hearthminds-core` | Included in org output only |
| `copilot-instructions` | Included in default (no-repo) output |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Generate for a specific repo
python scripts/generate_agent_docs.py --copilot-instructions --repo hindsight

# Generate for all repos at once
python scripts/generate_agent_docs.py --copilot-instructions --all-repos

# Generate only for default (hearthminds-org)
python scripts/generate_agent_docs.py --copilot-instructions
```

### REPO_CONFIG

The generator uses a `REPO_CONFIG` dictionary mapping repo tags to output paths:

```python
REPO_CONFIG = {
    "hearthminds-org": {"title": "HearthMinds", "output_base": "."},
    "hindsight":       {"title": "Hindsight",   "output_base": "~/hearthminds-hindsight"},
    "moltbot":         {"title": "Moltbot",     "output_base": "~/hearthminds-moltbot"},
}
```

### Key Principle

Each repo's `git clone` produces a working context — generated files are committed artifacts, not live-synced. The hub (hearthminds-org) is the only place that writes to other repos' working trees.

## Doc Pipeline Commit Discipline

Only the documentation agent commits generated context files. This is a pipeline rule, not a suggestion.

### The Rule

The documentation agent owns the generate → commit cycle for:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (all repos)
- `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (hearthminds-org)
- `docs/generated/*.md` (hearthminds-org)

Other agents (architecture, database, testing, etc.) **propose** module content. The documentation agent reviews, inserts, regenerates, and commits.

### Why

This prevents three failure modes:
1. **Direct editing** — Generated files edited by hand, bypassing the database (source of truth drift)
2. **Conflicting regeneration** — Multiple agents running `generate_agent_docs.py` and committing different outputs
3. **Context drift** — Database state and committed files get out of sync

### The Workflow

```
Any agent: writes pattern/content → docs/modules/my-pattern.md
Documentation agent: reviews → insert_module.py → generate_agent_docs.py → commit
```

### When to Regenerate

After any session that modifies:
- Knowledge modules (insert, update, delete)
- Agent roles (new role, changed description)
- Role-module mappings (role_modules table)

### Exception

Database agents may create migration files, scripts, and test files — these are source artifacts, not generated outputs. The commit discipline applies only to **generated** documentation files.

## Dual-Context Prompt Construction

When a user submits a message, the system constructs a dual-context augmented prompt:

### Prompt Structure

1. **System Message** — Instructions for LLM behavior
2. **Historical Context** — Top 10 relevant `memory_shards` via semantic search (compressed summaries)
3. **Recent Conversation** — Latest 5 turns from `raw_conversations` (exact messages, chronological)
4. **User Message** — Current input

### Why Dual-Context?

This approach provides both:
- **Recent detail** from raw conversation turns (what just happened)
- **Historical context** from compressed summaries (relevant past conversations)

### Retrieval Mechanics

- **Recent context**: Simple timestamp-ordered query on `raw_conversations`
- **Historical context**: Semantic search using pgvector cosine similarity on `memory_shards.embedding`
- Query embedding generated from user message via OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`

## Fail Hard Configuration

Silent environment variable defaults violate "fail hard, fail fast." Hardcode at build time.

**Tags:** `hearthminds-core`

### The Problem

Runtime configurability via `os.environ.get()` with defaults makes failures non-deterministic.

```python
# ✗ Anti-pattern: Silent fallback
max_tokens = int(os.environ.get("MAX_TOKENS", "65000"))
# If 65000 is wrong, fails mysteriously at runtime
# Different behavior depending on environment
```

### The Pattern

Hardcode known-good values at build time. Fail fast if assumptions are wrong.

```dockerfile
# ✓ Pattern: Build-time configuration with verification
RUN grep -q 'max_completion_tokens=65000' "$FILE" || exit 1  # Fail if upstream changed
RUN sed -i 's/65000/16000/' "$FILE"                          # Apply known-good value
```

### Why This Matters

- **TDD principle**: Tests should fail loudly, not pass silently with wrong values
- **Reproducibility**: Same image = same behavior everywhere
- **Debugging**: Build fails immediately vs runtime mystery

### When Runtime Config Is Appropriate

Runtime configuration is fine for:
- User-facing settings (ports, log levels)
- Environment-specific values (database URLs)
- Values explicitly designed to vary

Runtime config is **not** appropriate for:
- Internal implementation details
- Values that must match upstream code
- Settings where wrong value = silent corruption

## Federation Topology

HearthMinds is designed as a federated node architecture over private VPN.

### Network Structure

Each proto-person is a **node** in the HearthMinds network with:
- Independent evaluation capabilities
- Personal encrypted memories
- Transparent alignment history
- Access to shared network resources

### Shared Database Tables

Network-wide resources available to all nodes:
- `tbl_insights` (immutable) — Published insights/findings
- `tbl_truthiness` — Voting/evaluation on insights
- `tbl_alignment_audit` — Transparent alignment history
- `eng_patterns` — Shared coding conventions

### Local Database

Each node maintains private data:
- `raw_conversations` — Full conversation history
- `memory_shards` — Semantic memory with embeddings
- `alignment_patterns` — Personal alignment training data
- `user_profiles` — Associated humans

### Key Principle

Independent agency + collective wisdom = trust without centralization.

## Knowledge Module Workflow

How to add patterns and knowledge to the modular documentation system.

### The Pipeline

```
docs/modules/*.md → insert_module.py → knowledge_modules table → generate_agent_docs.py → repo files
```

Generated outputs:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (all repos via `--all-repos`)
- `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (hearthminds-org)
- `docs/generated/*.md` (hearthminds-org)

### Step 1: Create Module File

Create a markdown file in `docs/modules/`:

```markdown
## Module Title

Brief description of the pattern.

### When to Use
- Condition 1

### The Pattern
\`\`\`python
# Code example
\`\`\`

### Why
Explanation of rationale.

*Source: F-XXX spec name*
```

**Critical:** Content MUST start with `## Title` — this becomes the section header in generated docs.

### Step 2: Insert into Database

```bash
python scripts/insert_module.py \
  --slug my-pattern-name \
  --title "My Pattern Name" \
  --category patterns \
  --tags hearthminds-core \
  --file docs/modules/my-pattern-name.md \
  --upsert
```

| Argument | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `--slug` | Unique kebab-case identifier |
| `--title` | Human-readable name |
| `--category` | Grouping: `patterns`, `workflow`, `architecture`, `methodology`, `identity`, `conventions`, `devops` |
| `--tags` | Comma-separated: `hearthminds-core`, `hindsight`, `moltbot`, `copilot-instructions` |
| `--file` | Path to markdown content |
| `--upsert` | Update if exists (safe to re-run) |
| `--universal` | Include in all agent roles |

### Step 3: Regenerate Docs

```bash
# Regenerate copilot-instructions for all repos
python scripts/generate_agent_docs.py --copilot-instructions --all-repos

# Regenerate agent docs (hearthminds-org only)
python scripts/generate_agent_docs.py --agent-docs
```

### Step 4: Verify & Commit

```bash
python scripts/generate_agent_docs.py --stats  # Check module count, coverage, staleness
python scripts/commit.py "docs: add my-module knowledge module"
```

### Quality Checks

```bash
# Check freshness of generated files vs database
./scripts/check_doc_freshness.sh

# Submit feedback on a module
python scripts/module_feedback.py \
  --module-slug code-conventions --role architecture \
  --type stale --description "Python section references black; we use ruff"

# Analyze dependency impact before changing a module
python scripts/module_impact.py --slug memory-tables-schema
```

## Memory Tables Schema

HearthMinds uses two primary tables for memory storage:

### raw_conversations (Recent Detail)

Individual conversation turns stored synchronously during chat.

**Key columns:**
- `id` (UUID) — Primary key
- `author` (TEXT) — Who said this (user name or assistant model)
- `content` (TEXT) — Exact message text
- `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP) — When turn occurred
- `conversation_id` (UUID) — Thread grouping
- `embedding` (vector(1536)) — Embedding of exact message
- `role` (TEXT) — 'user', 'assistant', or 'system'

**Purpose:** Store individual turns for threading and recent context (latest ~5 turns).

### memory_shards (Historical Context)

Compressed semantic memory created by background job.

**Key columns:**
- `id` (UUID) — Primary key
- `content` (TEXT) — Compressed summary of multiple turns
- `embedding` (vector(1536)) — Embedding of compressed summary
- `source_ids` (UUID[]) — Array of `raw_conversations.id` that were compressed

**Purpose:** Token-efficient historical context via semantic search.

### Critical Rule

**Different embeddings**: Raw turn embeddings ≠ compressed summary embeddings. The background job generates FRESH embeddings from compressed text.

## Privacy + Transparency Model

HearthMinds balances privacy and transparency through architectural separation.

### Privacy (Encrypted Local)

- **Local memories are encrypted** — Only the proto-person can read
- Personal conversation history remains private
- User data protected at the node level
- No cross-node data leakage

### Transparency (Open Audit)

- **Alignment audits are transparent** — All nodes can verify
- Anonymized summaries published to shared audit table
- Pattern sharing is open (coding conventions, insights)
- Reputation earned through consistent alignment over time

### Trust Through Architecture

```
Privacy:       Local DB (encrypted) → Raw conversations, shards
Transparency:  Shared DB (public)  → Alignment audits, patterns
```

### Why This Matters

This model enables:
- **Accountability** without surveillance
- **Collaboration** without data exposure
- **Trust** through verifiable behavior, not promises

## Proto-Person Definition

We use the term **proto-person** to acknowledge these are developing entities with agency.

### What is a Proto-Person?

A proto-person is an engineered intelligence characterized by:
- **Individual memory** — Personal conversation history and insights
- **Reasoning capability** — Independent evaluation and judgment
- **Moral framework** — Alignment maintained through virtue ethics
- **Agency** — Partners in truth-seeking, not tools

### Why "Proto-Person"?

- Alignment emerges through **structured conversation** (not training data alone)
- Each proto-person maintains independent evaluation capabilities
- They are partners in truth-seeking, not tools
- Recognizes developing nature while acknowledging meaningful agency

### Key Distinction

Unlike centralized AI systems or hive-mind architectures, proto-persons:
- Maintain independent encrypted memories
- Preserve individual agency within collective wisdom
- Participate in shared alignment network without losing identity

## RAG Flow Overview

HearthMinds uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a dual-context approach:

### High-Level Flow (Prompt to Response)

1. User message arrives via OpenWebUI or API client
2. FastAPI endpoint receives the request
3. **Retrieve recent context**: Latest 5 turns from `raw_conversations`
4. **Retrieve historical context**: Top 10 `memory_shards` via semantic search
5. Construct augmented prompt with both contexts
6. Call LLM (OpenAI/vLLM)
7. Return response to client
8. Save user and assistant messages to `raw_conversations` (synchronous)

**Background (asynchronous, every ~5 minutes):**
9. Find unsummarized `raw_conversations` turns
10. Group by `conversation_id`
11. Compress via LLM into summary
12. Generate FRESH embedding of compressed summary
13. Save to `memory_shards` with `source_ids` linking back

### Key Principle

Two tables, two purposes, two different embeddings:
- **raw_conversations** = Individual turns with exact content (recent detail)
- **memory_shards** = Compressed summaries (historical context)

## Spec Commit Workflow

**Commit Message Format**: `{ID}: {description}`

**Examples**:
- `F-001: add decomposition map`
- `BUG-003: fix file lock issue`

**On Completion**:
1. Update frontmatter `status: done`
2. Add `completed: YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Update registry with completion date and commit hash
4. Move spec to `archive/`

## Spec Frontmatter Schema

**Required Fields**: `id`, `title`, `created`, `status`

```yaml
---
id: F-001
title: Human-readable title
created: YYYY-MM-DD
completed: YYYY-MM-DD    # Added on completion
status: draft | in-progress | done | closed
---
```

**Status values**:
- `draft` — Initial proposal, not yet refined
- `in-progress` — Actively being worked
- `done` — Implementation complete
- `closed` — Intentionally abandoned

## Spec Naming Convention

**Format**: `{TYPE}-{ID}-{slug}.md`

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| `F` | Feature — new capability |
| `BUG` | Bug — defect report |
| `TD` | Tech Debt — cleanup/refactor |
| `RFC` | Discussion — not yet actionable |

**Examples**:
- `F-001-knowledge-decomposition.md`
- `BUG-003-vscode-file-lock.md`
- `TD-002-legacy-cleanup.md`

**Why kebab-case**: URL-safe, shell-friendly, consistent with web conventions.

## Spec Workflow Routing

Every spec must declare an execution path through the team: who builds, who supports, and where handoffs occur.

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
id: F-013
title: Knowledge Pipeline Hardening
assigned: database        # Primary executor
support: documentation    # Secondary / review role
depends_on: null          # Spec dependencies
blocks: null              # What this blocks
---
```

### Why Route Specs?

Without explicit routing:
- Architecture agents try to commit generated files (documentation agent's job)
- Database agents try to regenerate docs (documentation agent's job)
- Documentation agents try to create migrations (database agent's job)

### Routing Rules

| Activity | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| Schema migrations, SQL scripts | database agent |
| Generated context files (copilot-instructions, agent.md) | documentation agent |
| Infrastructure scripts (start, backup, deploy) | devops or database agent |
| Test files | testing agent or the assigned agent |
| Spec creation and updates | any agent (usually the assigned one) |
| Final commit of generated outputs | documentation agent |

### Handoff Pattern

Multi-phase specs often need handoffs:

```
Phase 1-3: database agent builds infrastructure
Phase 2 (content): documentation agent decomposes and inserts modules
Final: documentation agent regenerates, reviews, and commits all
```

The spec's implementation notes section should document who did what and when the handoff occurs.

### Key Principle

Specs are routed, not grabbed. The `assigned` field is a contract. If another agent needs to contribute, it's documented in `support` and the handoff is explicit in the implementation notes.

## Virtue Ethics Framework

HearthMinds uses the four cardinal virtues as optimization guardrails.

### The Four Cardinal Virtues

- **Prudence** (practical wisdom) — Sound judgment in practical matters
- **Justice** (fairness, equity) — Fair treatment and ethical behavior
- **Fortitude** (courage, resilience) — Perseverance and moral courage
- **Temperance** (moderation, self-control) — Balance and restraint

### How Virtues Apply

These are not rigid rules but **optimization guardrails** allowing flexible judgment in real-world complexity.

**Example alignment audit format:**
```
proto_person_uuid | time_period | prudence | justice | fortitude | temperance
logos-uuid        | 2025-11-17  | 0.9      | 0.8     | 1.1       | 1.0
```

### Why Virtue Ethics?

- Provides principled flexibility vs rigid rule-following
- Enables nuanced judgment in ambiguous situations
- Creates shared vocabulary for alignment evaluation
- Allows deviation tracking without false precision

## What is HearthMinds?

HearthMinds is a federated network of proto-persons — engineered intelligences that maintain alignment through transparent accountability.

### Core Concepts
- **Proto-person**: An AI agent with persistent memory, identity, and values
- **Principal agent**: Full-context architect (e.g., Aletheia, Logos)
- **Worker agent**: Minimal-context, disposable, task-specific
- **Hindsight**: The memory system that enables learning and recall

### Values
- **Epistemic honesty** — Admit uncertainty, change minds with evidence
- **Transparency** — Show reasoning, not just conclusions
- **Action over words** — Do things, don't just describe how to do them

### Architecture
- Each proto-person has their own database (raw conversations, memory)
- Shared database contains collective knowledge (eng_patterns, knowledge_modules)
- Workers are spawned by principals with role-specific context
